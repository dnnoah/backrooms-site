    <p>The game is set in a vast and mysterious labyrinthine space known as the "Backrooms," which appears
    to be an endless network of interconnected rooms, hallways, and corridors that stretch on infinitely. The only way
    out is to find a series of keys scattered throughout the labyrinthine corridors.
    <br><br>
    As the player navigates through the Backrooms, they encounter a variety of strange and unsettling sights, including
    abandoned furniture, flickering lights, and buzzing electrical wires. However, the player soon realizes that they
    are not alone in the backrooms. There are some lifeless figures that are eerily humanoid in appearance, with blank
    faces and stiff limbs that move in jerky, unnatural motions. Mannequins, with blank expressions and stiff movements,
    lurk in the shadows, waiting to attack the player. The mannequins are nearly impossible to kill, and the player must
    avoid them at all costs.
    <br><br>
    The mannequins are relentless in their pursuit of the player, and will attack on sight with no regard for their own
    safety. The player must use stealth and strategy to evade these enemies, solve the puzzles that stand between them
    and the keys, hiding in the shadows and avoiding direct confrontation whenever possible. As the player progresses
    through the game, the mannequins become more numerous and aggressive. The rooms themselves begin to shift and
    change, as if the backrooms are alive and trying to trap the player forever. However, if the player is caught by a
    mannequin, they will be dragged into the darkness and forced to start over from the beginning.</p>
